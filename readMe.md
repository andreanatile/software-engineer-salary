# Disposable Income Minus Cost of Living for Software Engineers in Top-Paying Cities

The goal of this report is to show how much a software engineer can save in the top-paying cities.

## Data

Salaries were taken from [Levels.fyi's report 2022](https://www.levels.fyi/2022/).
Cost of living data was sourced from Numbeo, specifically the dataset obtained from [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/debdutta/cost-of-living-index-by-country).

## Methodology

I have calculated the net income for a single person without children in each city.
The yearly cost of living is determined by multiplying the cost of living in New York for a person renting a one-bedroom apartment outside the city center ($4,000) by the cost of living plus rent divided by 100, and then multiplying the result by 12.
